//time complexity is directly proportional to input n.
//It is a three types... (1)Best Case. (2)Average Case.(3)Wrost CAse.
//(1)position=1. omega(1)
//(2)n+1/2omega(n+1/2)
//(3)proportional to omega(n)
//Always consider worst cas eduring program writing 



//Space Complexity
//Arrays.. input size increase the memory space 
// in this case space complexity is heavilly depends on input size
